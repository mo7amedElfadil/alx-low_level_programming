# 0x0D-preprocessor

A Preprocessor in C is a program that processes or analyzes the source code file before it is given to the compiler. It plays an important role in the program execution process. In the C program development cycle, the source code (.C program) is given to the preprocessor before it is compiled.

### Advantages of Preprocessor in C

- It takes action according to special instructions called Preprocessor directives which begin with #.
- Joins any lines that end with a backslash character into a single line.
- Divides the program into a stream of tokens.
- Remove comments and replaces them by a single space.
- Processes preprocessor directives and expands macros.
- Replaces escape sequences by their equivalent internal representation.
- Concatenates adjacent constant character strings.
- Replaces trigraph sequences (Non-ASCII character sets) by their equivalent.
